## About me
I am currently a master's student at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), pursuing my passion for robotics with a focus on planning. I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Automation Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). During my third year, I had the opportunity to exchange to the University of Toronto for a semester. In the subsequent summer, I conducted research at the UTIAS Lab under the guidance of Prof. Jonathan Kelly, investigating certifiable multi-sensor calibration optimization. Additionally, I worked on my final year project on MAV Topological Sparse Graph Generation, supervised by Prof. Chen Benmei. 


## Besides research 

### Hobbies

One of my favorite activities is playing Mafia (The Werewolves of Millers Hollow, 狼人杀). I view it not merely as a logic game but as a psychological and dramatic performance. Logic is just one avenue to persuade (or "influence", or perhaps, "c-h-e-a-t") others; there are many other aspects to explore within the game, such as different players, game settings, and the intricacies of psychology. The brilliance of this game lies in the psychological warfare.  

I fell in love with Poker after learning probability and statistics. This game is not about gambling, but about self-discipling. 

### Curiosity

I have an insatiable thirst for "useless" knowledge—knowledge that may not directly relate to grades, work, or utilitarian efforts, such as philosophy and the history of science—because learning purely for the sake of learning brings me immense happiness. I enjoy studying the underlying logic and mechanisms behind complex systems. I tried to figure it out in the graduate school application and I concluded it into advices for future applicants. Click [here](https://github.com/Hao-Starrr/Graduate-Application-for-CUHKer) to see it. 

That might be called curiosity. Bertrand Russell is my idol in this regard.

There is a very interesting book - *[What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If%3F_(book))*. 

Here is my booklist about philosophy, economics, psychology, science, fictions, and so on. 

### Self-learning
I enjoy self-learning more than taking lectures in school. Actually, I took less than 20% lectures in the third and fourth year of undergraduate (for the courses don't take attendance) but still retain a good grade. Bilibili and YouTube are always great teachers.  

This is my open-source courses list that I will recommend to everyone. 

### Communication

My experience in the debate team taught me a lot about communication skills. In the minds of many, debate is defensive or aggressive talk and is considered an inefficient, consensus-eluding form of communication. However, debate is actually a way to persuade the audience (not the opponents) by clashing with the opposing stance. It can be seen as another form of presentation. On one hand, debate training teaches me the technics of verbal sparring. Once you master this, you naturally understand how to "Seek common ground while reserve differences" — just do the opposite of sparring. On the other hand, debate training instructs me in influencing third parties, persuading through logic, evoking emotions (and practicing in Mafia). I valued this experience.
