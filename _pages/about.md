## About me



I am a final-year undergraduate at CUHK, majoring in Mechanical and Automation Engineering. My research interest is robotics, especially applying optimization in calibration, planning, SLAM, etc.. I visited University of Toronto as an exchange student for a semester in my third year. In the following summer, I was at [UTIAS](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/) Lab researching certifiable multi-sensor calibration optimization, supervised by [Prof. Jonathan Kelly](http://stars.utias.utoronto.ca/~jkelly/). Currently, I am working on my final year project research about GPU accelerated mapping and planning under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Benmei](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~usr/).

I am applying for 23 Fall graduate schools. My destination is US, and my goal is to apply certifiable optimization algorithms in corridor based planning method to improve the robustness and safety. After that, I plan to enter the industry to convert the research to products. 







## Besides research 



I like playing the Mafia (The Werewolves of Millers Hollow, 狼人杀). I believe it is not a logic game but a psychology game, a drama performing game. Logic is only one of the ways to persuade (c-h-e-a-t) others. I enjoy exploring new things, finding phenomenon, guessing explanation, and testing. Different players, different game setting, the psychology, there are so many things to explore in this game. 

I like philosophy and science popularizing (watch videos or write my own articles). I am thirst for all "useless" knowledge, those no related to grade or work or any utilitarian effort. That is the pure happiness from learning. Russell is my idol. 

There is a very interesting book - *[What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If%3F_(book))*.

I am still constructing my web. (For example, take a better photo as profile.) If you have any suggestions, feel free to drop me an email!
