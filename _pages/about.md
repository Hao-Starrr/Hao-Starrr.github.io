## About me
I am an incoming master's student at the University of Pennsylvania (Upenn), pursuing my passion for robotics with a focus on planning. I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Automation Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). During my third year, I had the opportunity to study abroad at the University of Toronto as an exchange student for a semester. In the subsequent summer, I conducted research at the UTIAS Lab under the guidance of Prof. Jonathan Kelly, investigating certifiable multi-sensor calibration optimization. Additionally, I worked on my final year project on MAV Topological Sparse Graph Generation, supervised by Prof. Chen Benmei.


## Besides research 

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have diverse interests and hobbies. One of my favorite activities is playing Mafia (The Werewolves of Millers Hollow, 狼人杀). I view it not merely as a logic game but as a psychological and dramatic performance. Logic is just one avenue to persuade (or "influence", or perhaps, "c-h-e-a-t") others; there are many other aspects to explore within the game, such as different players, game settings, and the intricacies of psychology.

I also have a keen interest in philosophy and the history of science, which I enjoy exploring through videos and blog writing. I have an insatiable thirst for "useless" knowledge—knowledge that may not directly relate to grades, work, or utilitarian efforts—because learning purely for the sake of learning brings me immense happiness. Bertrand Russell is my idol in this regard.

There is a very interesting book - *[What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If%3F_(book))*.
