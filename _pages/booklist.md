In primary and middle school education, reading books often signifies engaging with literary works. However, I must admit that I am not an enthusiast of literature; hence, there are few literary works on this booklist. I believe that literature constitutes only a small fraction of human knowledge, and it cannot be equated with 'books'. There are many fascinating areas with books that are equally worthy of exploration.


The sequence of books is unrelated to my evaluations and comments.

Many of these books are ones I read many years ago, and the majority of the details within them have faded from memory. If the books I've read are forgotten, what's the meaning of reading? I believe it lies in the initial impact of "knowing" for the first time, in the sudden flash of insight when recalling a certain viewpoint years later, and in the shaping of one's perspective on the world as knowledge flows through the mind, just like water flowing through pipes and taking away stains.
