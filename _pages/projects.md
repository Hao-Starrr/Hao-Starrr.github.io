**Differential Wheeled Robot Lidar SLAM in Indoor Environment 2022**  
• Deployed **PRM** and **RRT\*** indoors generating global path in 2.0 second in **Gazebo** simulation environment.  
• Adapted **MPC** controller in dynamic state lattice following the trajectory, visualized by ROS **Rviz**.  
• Implement **EKF** against particle filter as localization and achieve 80% time decrease and higher accuracy.  
• Mapping by **Bresenham's line algorithm** with Lidar and wheel odometry data and corrected by loop closure.

**2D Path Planning Interface on OpenStreetMap 2022**  
• Implemented **DFS**, **BFS**, **Greedy Best First** compared with A\* planning algorithm on building dense 2D map.  
• Improved **weighted A\*** with diagonal heuristic and cross tie breaker achieving 40 times improvement in sparse grid map.  
• Developed algorithm visualization GUI interface interact with mouse clicking by **JAVA**.

**Information Retrieval (Named Entity Recognition) using Hidden Markov Model 2022**  
• Fitting the **HMM** transition and emission parameters with the train set of 6000 documents on MITMovie Dataset.  
• Implemented **Viterbi** algorithm and Laplace smoothing achieving 98% accuracy on 2000 test documents.

**3D Reconstruction in Augmented Reality Context 2023**  
• Estimated the homography that maps the video images onto the Penn Engineering logo points.  
• Established world coordinate system by AprilTags and solved **PnP** problem mapping objects to 3D view, heavily used **NumPy**.  
• Implemented visual odometry by **optical flow** and visualized the depth map.  
• Utilized **SIFT** matches and **RANSAC** estimated essential matrix to recover the pose and reconstructed 3D scene.
