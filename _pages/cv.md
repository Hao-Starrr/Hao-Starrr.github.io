# Research experience

**GPU-Accelerated Mapping and 3D Scene Graph-Based Planning**  <span style="float:right;">Aug. 2022 – Present</span>  
*Supervisor: Prof. Chen Benmei, MAE CUHK & ECE NUS*  

* Working on the combination of the mapping and planning on limited onboard computational resources.
* Collaboratively proposed to utilize the GPU-accelerated ESDFs and 3D Scene Graph for planning.
* Built up the simulation environment on ROS and initially tested the idea’s feasibility.
* Deployed mapping and planning functions on UAV and will prune the unnecessary function to improve the computational speed.

<br />

**Certifiably Multi-Sensors Extrinsic Parameters Calibration Optimization**  <span style="float:right;">May 2022 – Oct. 2022</span>  
*Supervisor: Prof. Jonathan Kelly, STARS Laboratory, UTIAS, UofT*  

* Optimized trajectory alignment by SDP relaxation to calibrate the relative extrinsic parameters of the multi-camera.
* Independently completed GN solver dealing with scale cases and derived the Lie algebra pose perturbation model.
* Realized the linear solver proposed before as a comparative method. Tested ORB-SLAM3 for generating the raw data.
* Contributed to the visualization and generated diagrams in the paper.

<br />

**Finite-time Stable Control for Multi-agent Systems**  <span style="float:right;">May 2020 – Sept. 2020  </span>  
*Supervisor: Dr. Han Dongkun, MAE, CUHK*  

* Designed UAV control algorithm. Redesigned the barrier function and control algorithm, and found a new Lyapunov function to satisfy the time convergence requirement and stability requirement simultaneously.
* Simulated the position and speed of the UAVs by MATLAB at each timestep and generated a video to visualize the results. 
* The result won the annual **Best Project Award**. I was awarded the Innovation and Creativity Scholarship.
