## Research and Work Experience

**CUHK T Stone Robotics Institute, Unmanned Systems Research Group**
<span style="float:right;">Oct. 2022 – Mar. 2023</span>  
_Undergraduate Research Assistant_
<span style="float:right;">_Hong Kong_</span>

- Implemented topological sparse graphs generation for pre-build volumetric maps, filled the gap between drone mapping and planning based on existing GPU-mapping library, achieved autonomous exploration of environment without human intervention.
- Developed map saving and loading functions by serialization in C++, enabling multiple drones to share the rough pre-built maps and refine the exploration with multiple speed. Built and tested the simulation environment in Gazabo.
- Deployed global and local planners on real-world unmanned air vehicle, successfully automatically controlled the drone in digitalized building 3D point cloud models which is built by on-board GPU increasing the mapping speed 10 times.

- Researched convex optimization algorithms (SDP relaxation) to calibrate the extrinsic parameters in robot sensors trajectory alignment, making the optimized result certifiable in even targetless environment.
- Developed a GN solver for scaled cases in Python, enabling the algorithm used on monocular camera, expanding the applicability.
- Innovatively derived the Lie algebra pose perturbation model. Visualized the optimization results of sensor poses by Matplotlib.
